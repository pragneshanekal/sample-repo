# LangGraph Python Code Generation Assistant

## Project Description
The LangGraph Python Code Generation Assistant is a web application designed to help users generate well-documented Python code based on their programming requirements. By leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI\'s language models, this assistant interprets user specifications, generates code with comprehensive documentation, and provides detailed explanations of the implementation. This tool aims to simplify the coding process, making it accessible for both novice and experienced programmers.

## Key Features
- **Understanding Programming Requirements**: The assistant interprets user-provided specifications to comprehend the desired functionality.
- **Code Generation with Documentation**: It produces code that includes comprehensive documentation, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
- **Implementation Explanation**: The assistant provides detailed explanations of the code implementation to facilitate user understanding.

## Code Structure

└── README.md            # Project documentation

```

### Key Files and Modules
- **frontend.py**: This file contains the Streamlit application that serves as the user interface. It allows users to input their programming requirements and API key, and displays the generated code and explanations.
- **backend.py**: This file implements the core logic for processing user requirements and generating code using LangGraph and OpenAI\'s models.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the necessary Python packages required to run the application.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- An OpenAI API key

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   <bash>
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langgraph-code-assistant.git
   cd langgraph-code-assistant
   </bash>

2. **Set up the development environment**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using:
   <bash>
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
   </bash>

3. **Install dependencies**:
   <bash>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   </bash>

4. **Run the application**:
   <bash>
   streamlit run frontend.py
   </bash>

## Dependencies
- `langgraph`: For managing the code generation workflow.
- `streamlit`: For creating the web application interface.
- `pydantic`: For data validation and settings management.
- `langchain_openai`: For integrating OpenAI\'s language models.
- `langchain_core`: For core functionalities of LangChain.
- `logging`: For logging application events and errors.

## Configuration Instructions
To use the application, you need to provide your OpenAI API key. Enter the key in the sidebar of the Streamlit application to enable code generation.

## Usage Examples
1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Enter your programming requirements in the text area.
3. Provide your OpenAI API key in the sidebar.
4. Click the "Generate Code" button to see the generated code and its explanation.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that your OpenAI API key is valid and has the necessary permissions.
- If you encounter any errors during code generation, check the logs for detailed error messages.
- Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
