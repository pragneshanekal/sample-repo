# LangGraph Code Generation Assistant

## Project Description
The LangGraph Code Generation Assistant is a powerful tool designed to assist developers in generating code based on user-defined programming requirements. It leverages advanced language models to interpret specifications, produce well-documented code, identify edge cases, and provide detailed implementation explanations. This project addresses the common challenge of translating vague programming requirements into functional code, enhancing productivity and code quality.

## Key Features
- **Understanding Programming Requirements**: Interprets user-provided specifications to comprehend desired functionality.
- **Code Generation with Documentation**: Produces code that includes comprehensive documentation for clarity and maintainability.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Identifies and addresses potential edge cases to enhance code robustness and reliability.
- **Implementation Explanation**: Provides detailed explanations of the code implementation to facilitate user understanding.

## Code Structure

```
/langgraph_code_generation_assistant
│
├── frontend.py          # Streamlit frontend for user interaction
└── backend.py           # Backend logic for code generation and processing

```

### Key Files
- **frontend.py**: This file contains the Streamlit application that serves as the user interface. It allows users to input their programming requirements and displays the generated code, documentation, and implementation details.
- **backend.py**: This file implements the core logic for code generation using the LangGraph framework. It processes user requirements and interacts with the OpenAI API to generate code and documentation.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- An OpenAI API key

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   <bash>
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langgraph_code_generation_assistant.git
   cd langgraph_code_generation_assistant
   </bash>

2. **Set up the development environment**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using:
   <bash>
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
   </bash>

3. **Install dependencies**:
   <bash>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   </bash>

4. **Run the application**:
   <bash>
   streamlit run frontend.py
   </bash>

## Dependencies
- `langgraph`
- `streamlit`
- `pydantic`
- `langchain_openai`
- `langchain_core`

## Configuration Instructions
- Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar of the Streamlit application to enable code generation functionality.

## Usage Examples
1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar.
3. Describe your programming requirements in the text area.
4. Click the "Generate Code" button to receive:
   - Fully documented code
   - Implementation explanation
   - Edge case considerations

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If you encounter an error related to the OpenAI API, ensure that your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions.
- For issues with package installations, verify that you are using the correct Python version and that your virtual environment is activated.
